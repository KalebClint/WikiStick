    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Writers workspace was one of my first programs I created using Visual Studio Forms and c#. This was a year 11 school
        project that I worked on. So for about a term of school I was working on it quite a bit. The Writers Workspace is well, 
        a workspace for writers. Although I didn't make it super polished, I got it to a decent place however. It has an area for you
        to write your novel, a place to create 'character cards.' So basically put basic details of your characers to look at for quick reminders.
        Things like appearances mostly. I did the same for places, so you can create, edit and delete cards. It had a random generator as well, for 
        names of places, people, colors, numbers, etc. All of it was saveable as well. <br><br>
        Anyway, I got an achieved for that, which again was strange. Supposedly its becouse I didn't do well in my devlog, which is a seperate 
        internal. But oh well, I learned a decent amoutn from it, but the software wasn't quite at a point where it would be very useful. It would
        require a little more polishing just to look nice. Since Visual studios windows forms isn't a great place to make nice looking applications.
        As far as I was able to figure out anyway.
