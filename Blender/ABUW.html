    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This was one of my most liked peices of work for a while, I found it looked nice, but also combined several different
        things I'd learned about blender. I used geometry node affects for some of the 'Suzan Posters' and everything else I 
        modelled after my own setup. I was able to put it in my asset library and can access those assets anywhere.
