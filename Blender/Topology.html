    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Topology is something I never really even knew about for the longest time while I used blender. When I modelled stuff I 
        just did it in the best way I could. However this was always a little bit of an issue as when modelling more complex things,
        not only was it often messy, but often times didn't work out.
        <br>The main area this became a problem with wass when I wanted to learn cahracter creation in blender. Topology for this is 
        pretty much a must. As you need to be able to texture the characters well, rig, and animate them. Which is much more difficult
        when you don't have the proper topology for the models.
        <br>Now although I havn't lreaned topology a ton myself, I do know the basics of what it is.

    <h3>What is Topology.</h3>
    <p>Topology is basically the arrangemnt of faces on your mesh. There is good topology, and there is bad Topology.
        <br>Inside Topology, thier is three different types of faces that you can have. (For clarity, I do not mean human 
        faces.) Triangles, Quads, or N-gons. Triangles obviusly have three sides, while Quads have four, and n-gons have five
        or more.
        <br>Good topology, is when you have a mesh that is made up of only quads, you don't want any triangles or n-gons, as those 
        will definately mess things up. You want your faces on a mesh to be quads, but you also want them to all be clean. This way 
        all sorts of other things you do will be much easier. If you want to texture, rig, animate, etc. Having proper topology will make 
        that much easier.
