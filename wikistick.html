        <h3 id="header">Overview</h3>
        <p>
            The WikiStick is a personal wiki on all of my techy projects and a place to put anything I might be learning or researching.
            This was partially suggested that I do this to use Feynman's technique, where basically the best way to learn something is to
            teach it. As per the video a website can be a useful thing to have and I decided why not do it, but make it in more of a wiki
            format. It is also helping me to learn how to host and create websites, using Html, CSS, and Javascript.
            <br>
            This wiki will contain most every technical project I have made and will make so that its all in one spot. If I ever forget something
            or need a quick reminder I can access it from pretty much everywhere. However so can literally anyone, so any project I've made, or
            any topic I've researched, will be available here.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also honestly have far too many hobbies and far too many projects that are only half completed, this will contain them all and
            maybe some day I'll get around to finishing some of them.

            (In terms of the name, well I am The Stick. So this is the WikiStick, the Wiki of the Stick. You should read Brandon Sanderson)

        <h3 id="header">How It Works</h3>
        <p>
           I'm using a github repo which I setup with github pages, (see tutorial on specificaly how to do so.) And purchased a cheap domain
            name which redirects to said website. I have a bunch of html pages sorted in folders with a few cascading style sheets and even
            a javascript file. The main thing about a wiki it does lack is the client side ability to edit pages, however I was unsure how 
            feasable that would be with Github. And I am poor, so for now it will suffice.
            <br>
            After making changes all I need to do is simply push to github and the server is up to date, running 24/7
