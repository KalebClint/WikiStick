<div class="left-content">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Statues was the game I made for my first ever game jam. Its a simple 3D horror game where 
    you are lost inside a dark mansion with nothing but a torch. The mansion is full of
    statues, these statues will move towards you, unless you are looking at them. It was a simple
    game with not great graphics or even full funcionality but it was a good learning experience
      and a decent attempt for my first try.
      <br> <br>
      As I actually quite liked the idea I decided to re-make the game for my Digitech project in 2024,
      this is my current in progress project.
