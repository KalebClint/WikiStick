    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>A Sunny Day At Vampireville was the first game jam I did with a team, before that I had never worked on a 
      game with anyone else before. I was the only programmer and it was definately different not having to worry
      about any of the modelling or sounds. There was a bit more we could have done but overall I think we made a
      decent enough game. I remember this game partially becouse our placing was number 64, and it was the 64th Godot
      Wild Game Jam.
