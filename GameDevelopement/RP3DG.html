    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>What I have nicknamed the PP3DG, is able to generate a full and completely random
      map that is completely different every time.
      
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
      Here I will go over basically how much I understand of how it works, as so far its probably
      the most complex feature I had implemented into Godot. 
      <br>
      Basically the map is made up of cells, each cell has four walls and four doors, the grid map
      is used to create rooms with cells together. Each cell has an index dependant on the type, 
        say the index is 0 then the type is a room cell. or 1 = door cell. 2 = hallway cell and 
        3 = to a border cell. Further numbers is just for different types of rooms.
        <br>
          When two cells are put next to each other, it gets the two edges that are right next to
          each other, and does something to it dependent on the type of cell. For instance if its a 
          doorway next to a hallway, it gets rid of both walls, and the door of the hallway cell,
          but it keeps the doorway to the doorway cell. It goes through all cells and edges and does this
          until their all finished.
          <br>
         To set the door cells I belive it gets two rooms, and find the closest cells between those two 
              rooms, then sets those as the doors and generates a hallway imbetween them. I'll admit I'm
              not certain how the hallway stuff works tho, something to do with triangulation.

    <h3>What I learned</h3>
  <p>This tutorial was actually very helpful for my learning, as I had never before used a grid map, and the way the
    person coded was pretty different to mine, showing me more options. First of these was the grid map, I had never used
    these before but the tutorial showed me the basics of how it works and it seems like something that could be pretty 
    useful for future projects.
    <br>
      Along with this was a couple fo smallers things, by putting @tool at the top of the script it allows you to use the 
      script in the editor, meanign you don't have to run the game every time you want to test it. The other is that you can
      specifiy variable types by using say
      <br><b>var example : int</b>
