    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>What I have nicknamed the PP3DG, is able to generate a full and completely random
      map that is completely different every time.
      
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
      Here I will go over basically how much I understand of how it works, as so far its probably
      the most complex feature I had implemented into Godot. 
      <br>
      Basically the map is made up of cells, each cell has four wals and four doors, the grid map
      is used to create rooms with cells together. Each cell has an index dependant on the type, 
        say the index is 0 then the type is a room cell. or 1 = door cell. 2 = hallway cell and 
        3 = to a border cell. Further numbers is just for different types of rooms.
