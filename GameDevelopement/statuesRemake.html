      <h1 id="header">Statues Remake - Digitech Project</h1>
  
<div class="left-content">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p> This is the remake of one of my first games, Statues is a game where you are in a strange mansion
      with nothing but a torch. Your goal is to find a magical artifact and get out. Unbeknownst to you however
      the mansion is full of statues. Every time you turn they seem to be closer and closer, but they never seem 
      to be able to reach you...
      <br>
        <br>
      I decided I quite liked the idea of this game and would try to remake it as something much better. For my 
      year 12 digitech internal we were given the opportunity to make a video game, so this is what I decided to go with.
      This project is currently in progress, but if all goes well I plan to add much more functionality and slightly
      better graphics then the original. 
          <br> <br>
      Differences:
    </p>
              
    <ul>
        <li>Overall better working base features</li>
        <li>Randomly Procedural Generated 3D map (or RPG3DM I guess.)</li>
        <li>Multiplayer Support (Because I can, no other reason)</li>
      <li>Better GUI and Audio</li>
    </ul>
