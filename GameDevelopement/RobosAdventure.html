    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This is a short adventure game where you play as a small Robot, first fighting enemies out in space, 
        before landing in a facility, with the intent of getting access codes for your commander.
      <br> 
        <br>
      This was a somewhat interesting gam jam, I belive it was the shortest Jam I had even done, only having a week
    to actually do it. If I remember however I didn't have the whole time to work on it. Some sort of interuption or something,
    that or I was simply lazy and didn't work on it as much as I should have.
    </p>


    <h3>Feedback / Learned</h3>
    <p>The main thing I think I learned from this gamejam, had to do with the controls, and kind of my mindset.
        <br>As I had been the one to make the game, I'd kind of chosen random controls for flying the spaceship.
        I tried to make them intuitive, but the thing is, they felt intuitive for me. Becouse I had been using them
        to test, and used them while I was making the features. So I got super used to them, and thought they actually 
        worked well.
        <br><br>Basically, just about any set of controls can work well for just about anything. Once you get used to them.
        The point of intuitive controls however, is controls that can work well, and you don't really need to get used to them.
        They should suit you as a begginer. So what I should have done was either pick controls I knew I didn't want while testing.
        Then once I have the features together, try to find the most intuitive controls. Or, well really and I should have gotten
        others to test it before putting it forward.
