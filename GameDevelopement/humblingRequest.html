          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p id="overiew">
              This game was an interesting one, although we had a big team, we either set the project too big or simply did not approach it quite right. The
              project was finished, but not at a very high level. However it was a learning experiance, working with a very large team and creating functions I had
              not before touched, such as the Inventory which was my main responsability. I was also unavalable for the second half of the Jam, but the rest of my
              team was able to pull it through. This was my second and last jam working with this team, as I decided likely I would solo most jams in the future.
