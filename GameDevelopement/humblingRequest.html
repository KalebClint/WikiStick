          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p id="overiew">
              This game was an interesting one, although we had a big team, we either set the project too big or simply did not approach it quite right. The
              project was finished, but not at a very high level. However it was a learning experiance, working with a very large team and creating functions I had
              not before touched, such as the Inventory which was my main responsability. I was also unavalable for the second half of the Jam, but the rest of my
              team was able to pull it through. This was my second and last jam working with this team, as I decided likely I would solo most jams in the future.
            <br><br>I would like to note it has nothing to do with the team I was working with. Overall they were pretty great. There was some decent
            coordiantion and we would have team meetings every so often. The reason I've decided I mostly prefer solo however is simply becouse of the way I work.
            When working with a team I've found I'm constantly more stressed about getting the job done, and it feels like I'm doing it not becouse I enjoy it. More 
            becouse I would feel bad for my team if I didn't get it done. This team was great however, and I enjoyed the two jams we worked on together.
