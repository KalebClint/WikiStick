    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The first time I picked up gaem developement back in Year Ten of highschool, so like 2022, I started
        off with unity. Spent a little while to download and install it, then spent ages following tutorials and learning everything
    I could about it. I quite enjoyed that, and thanks to Brackeys for the most part, got into Game Developement.
<br>However, at some point the next year, I stumbled upon Godot, and fell in love with it. I learnt it best I could, 
as I did with unity, and have been using it since. Both engines have strengths and weaknesses, I will go over my personal
preferences between the two. </p>

  <h3>Unity</h3>
  <p>As of writing this, it has actually been quite a while since I last even used Unity, so this will mostly come from memory, and I would 
      not quote on it. Unity is a great option for game development. My number one problem with it however, was the shear size.
      Since I never earlly had any high end computers at all, something like installing unity took hours. Creating a project took like thiry
      minutes. It ran decently enough, even with debugging, that proccess just took ages.
      <br>The main thing however was the amount of files as well, I made the mistake of trying to use Onedrive, which was suddenly loaded with
      hundreds of thousands of files. Breaking that onedrive for good, and as something I found a little crazy.
      <br> <br> One of the things I really liked about Unity however was its ability to debug in real time. While I'm debugging the game, I can still
      move around the scene, affect variables easily, and see everything exactly as its happening. This is more limited in Godot, you can only see through
      the camera while debugging, along with being able to access the proccess node tree and whatnot.
  </p>

  <h3>Godot</h3>
  Godot is crazy small and versatile, I could download, install and create a project in like a singular minute, on pretty low end laptops or pcs. 
  Despite this, it can still be used to create pretty decently large and good games. Godot also uses Python as the main coding language, 
  as opposed to Unities c#. 
  <br> Maybe the biggest thing though, is that in Godot it is worked by using a node based system, which is something that I quite like.
  It makes it very easy to organise and it simply just a way of thinking and doing that I much prefer.
