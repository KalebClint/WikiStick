          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p id="overiew">
              This was a pretty random project, at one point I started getting pretty interested in Special relativity thanks to couple random youtube
              videos. I've always enjoyed more advanced parts of physics, things like Einstines thoery of relativity, Quantumn mechanics, etc. But I found
              out about an interesting part of special relativity. I've always known about how gravity affects time and space, but turns out so does speed.
              <br> So basically I created a simple calculator that will calculate how long it will take to accelerate to a certain speed, assuming the acceleration
              is constant. This value will be different to what one might expect due to time Dilation. The faster you accelerate, the longer it takes to accelerate.

            // to a certain speed, taking time dilation into account.
            
            // Hopefully.
