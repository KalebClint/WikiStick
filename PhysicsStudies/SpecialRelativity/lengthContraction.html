          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p id="overiew">
              This was once again, another random project. Right after having made the thing for time Dilation, and getting a bit of help
              on that. I decided to look a little bit more into Length contraction. When I had first heard about it, I wasn't super
              interested. I'd thought high speeds affecting time was far more interesting. However, when I looked into it more, I got really
              interested. To put it simple, travelling at high speeds will literally reduce the distance you have to travel, it will warp
              space. The formula for how it warps space is as such.
              <br><br> L = L0 * SQRT( 1 - ( v^2 / c^2 ) )
              <br><br> I like numbers, and being able to see it properly. So the fact that there was a litteral equation like this, and was so simple,
              helped me to feel more motivated for it. <br> So I made a calculator. Nothing complex, all it does is take this equation, you input a 
              distance and a speed, and it calculates the affect of length contraction. I may or may not make a post on this, just to double check
              if it is correct, but it seems to be from what I've manually calculated.

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p>Length contraction is fascinating, and I mostly made this calculator becouse I wanted to know the affects it would have on short
            distances and small speeds. Even though the affect is negligible, I thought it might be a pretty cool random fact that I could 
            keep on me at all times. For example, did you know, that when you run a hundred meters, (so average speed of 3m/s.) Due to length
            contraction, you are actually only covering 5 Femtometers less than a 100 meters.
            <br>Now this is neglible, as a Femtometer is increadibly small, but its still pretty cool.
