          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p id="overiew">
              I've always known a little bit about special relativity, but at one point started getting pretty interested in it, 
              learning more about how certain things affect time and space. Not just gravity, but speed as well. Then how exactly 
              it affects time and space. How going quickly causes Time Dilation and length Contraction, both fascinating concepts,
              where simply moving at a really fast speed will change and warp both time and space.
              <br><br> Keep in mind this is simply my understanding of how it works, I may be wrong or innacurate.
          </p>


          <h3>Time Dilation</h3>
          <p>Time Dilation, at least in terms of speed, is basically how time is affected when moving at very high speeds. Time Dilation
            can be found by using Lorentz's equation, being <br><br> y = 1 / SQRT (  1 - ( v^2 / c^2 )  )
            <br><br> V^2 / c^2 can also just be replaced with the percentage of the speed of light you are travelling squared. So for 90%, you just put 
            0.9^2.
            <br> This will then result in a factor, for example, if you plug in 0.87, or are travelling 87% the speed of light, it will result in 
            a Lorentz Factor of 2. Which basically means that for every two seconds on the 'ship' only one second passes on earth.
            This factor may seem small, but beings to exponentially increase the closer you get to the speed of light, get up to 99.99% the speed of 
            light, and you get a Lorentz factor of 70.7. 99.999% the speed of light however, gets up to 223.6 
            <br><br>
            I'll try to explain why Time Dilation occurs, the easiest explanation I found, was by using a Photon clock. This is basically two mirrors
            facing each other, with a Photon bouncing between them. Assume every time the Photon hits the buttom mirror, thats a tick, or a 'second.'
            Now (Relative to earth) The Photon will just travel up, then down, between the mirrors. However, if you put the Photon Clock on something 
            moving very fast, it also has a horizontal motion as well. Inside the ship, it looks normal, but relative to earth, you would be able to see
            the Photon moving in a diagonal path. This increases the distance the Photon has to travel.
            <br>So basically, the faster you move the longer the Photon takes, if you were moving 87% the speed of light, every two ticks on earth, would only
            be one tick in the ship.
            <br>This affects everything though, as information has to travel, even though it moves very quick, the increase velocity causes it to travel a longer
            distance. This means everything moving at that velocity takes long to 'compute.' Which causes time to slow down for everything moving at that speed.

          </p>


          <h3>Length Contraction</h3>
          <p>Length Contraction is something I know less about, but basically, when moving at very high speeds, that will warp how you see space. The main cause 
            of this affect, is that no matter the reference point, Light will appear to be treaveling at the speed of light. Even if you are travelling at nearly 
            the speed of light, then light will still appear to be travelling at the speed of light. As I said I don't know much about how exactly it works, but 
            but that will cause space to become a bit warped and strange from the view of the ship.
          </p>


          <h3>Gravity</h3>
          <p>Gravity and Spactime. This has been soemthing I've been more familiar with for a while, how Gravity affects both space and time. For instance,
            Travelling near a black hole, with such intense gravity, will greatly slow down time for you. Take the movie Interstellar as a good example.
            One representation of Gravity, although a little bit innacruate, is like a trampoline. The Greater the gravity, the more it pushes down on the 
            trampoline, or 'space.' This is kind of a visual representation to show how nearby things will be drawn to it.
