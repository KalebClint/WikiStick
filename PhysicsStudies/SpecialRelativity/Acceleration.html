    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>After having played around with Time Dilation and speed, I got a question answered and discsovered there was a little bit more
        to it than I had thought. Turns out its not so simple with just 'Acceleration.' But there is actually two different types of acceleration.
        Proper Accleration, and Coordinate Acceleraion.
    </p>
              
    <h3>Proper Acceleraion</h3>
    <p>Proper acceleration can be considered as the act of acceleration. It can be measured currently by say an accelerometer. Say for example if you are 
        inside a car. When you feel the acceleration of the car, that is proepr acceleration.
    </p>

    <h3>Coordinate Acceleration</h3>
    <p>Coordinate Accceleraion however, is when you are outisde the car. You meausre specific places of accerlation from the car. You take the time, and you
        take the velocity to figure out the accerlation in that specific frame of time.
