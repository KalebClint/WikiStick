    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>My entire family has at least at some point been pretty avid readers, which is a big reason I frist got into reading
        at all. The first books I read when I was younger would have been the short ones like Zack power, or Beast Quest.
        But the first proper book I ever read was when my sister got me to read Percy Jackson. I loved it, and have read that series 
        several times over already.
    </p>

    <h3>Why I like It</h3>
    <p>This might be a bit of repetition, but the main reason I loved reading is becouse its a sort of form of living in those stories.
        I was a very avid reader for a long while, and really enjoyed reading books, finding different stories and 
        characters.
    </p>

    <h3>What I do with it</h3>
    <p>I don't do a lot of reading now anymore, though I am trying to get myself back into reading. Some of my favourite books are those 
        written by Brandon Sanderson, I could likely rant for a while as to why I love his books, they are honestly amazing. 
        Any time any of his books come out I will likely be immeditately getting and reading them within at least a day.
