    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>My family has always been full of gamers for the most part, so of course I grew up loving video games all my life. I've thought about it
        a couple of times, and If I really look back one of the first games I have ever played would likely be Wii fit. I remmeber seeing some 
        videos of when I was really young play that game. Other than that I can't rememebr anything earlier. The main game however, I started on 
        when I was young, and even still play today, was of course, Minecraft. That's been the game I have played more than any other, likely thousands
        of hours on it to be honest.
        <br>Other than that I faintly remember a few computer games I would play, one of the ones I remember better was soemthing I think called
        wolf quest. But other than that it was mostly Wii and everntually Wii U games that I would play from y childhood. As I think about it now
        even a few ps3 games. Things like mario kart wii and mario bros for the wii.
        <br>On the ps3, there were several lego games, lord of the rings, star wars, indina jones, even batman I think. We would play 
        ratchet and clank, little big planet, a couple racing games. Most of the og games to be honest.

    <h3>Why I like It</h3>
    <p>I really enjoy gaming, likely for similar reasons to most other people. It does depend on the game, but often times it's simply a nice way 
        to pass time. With some games I enjoy the challenge, others the puzzle parts to it. Some simply the lovely art styles.
        However, not a sinlge one of my favourite games I loved mostly becouse it was 'challenging' or 'looked nice.' All of the games
        that I love, all share one thing in common. They have a story. And a good one at that too.
        <br>Most everything I love to do in some way has to do with stories, I love movies and books, not just reading and watching, but even
        writing, 3d art. I enjoy game design not just becouse the coding can be (the wrost the thing ever) I mean fun. But becouse it's an
        opportunity to create a world, and to tell a story.
    </p>

    <h3>What I do with it</h3>
    <p>I still game quite often even now. I'm mostly a PC gamer, but there are several console games and maybe even a few mobile games that
        I quite enjoy. Although I don't have a super high end pc or anything, I still find ways to play all sorts of games. OFten times I'll 
        play online with a few friends as well, whether minecraft, roblox even, or some other random game.

    <h3>Favourite Games</h3>
    <p>I decided I would try to make a list of all of my favourite games, as I said above, a lot of these have to do with the story. Which is one 
        of the reason I think its hard to find a bad indie game. So many indie games are made for the stories, occasionaly heart breaking and devestaing,
        but thats why they can be so good.
