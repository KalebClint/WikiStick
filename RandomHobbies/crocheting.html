    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>I have a couple of siblings that crochet, and both did so before I ever did. One sister much older, and then my younger
        sister as well. They were probably where I got the main idea of crocheting from, but weren't the reason I ever started.
        I am a big Brandon Sanderson Fan, he's an auther of many books, and at one point, it was nearing christmas, I saw a really 
        cool and cute crochet pattern from one of his books. It was called a doomslug. I had the idea, and then basically started learning 
        to crochet, for no other reason then for a doomslug.
        <br>I crocheted the doomslug for one of my sisters, and my dad, both being Brandon Sanderson fans as well. By that point I had 
        crocheted three doomslugs, One test, and one for my sister and my dad. While on holiday I was talking with another fan, and decided 
        to crochet another doomslug for them as well.
        <br>I havn't crocheted much since then at all, a few things here and there. Only like two of them being a non-doomslug. As I actually 
        crocheteed two more doomslugs for other friends who were also Brandon Sanderson fans. Meaning I've made like six of them in total.
        One other thing I amde for another friend was a crochet of Sir Alexander from Elden ring, it didn't turn out great, but it was cute.
        <br>I'm not very good at crocheting overall, I didn't do too much learning before just figuring out how to do that one doomslug pattern,
        so I can't really do any other patterns very well at all.

    <h3>Why I like It</h3>
    <p>I don't mind crocheting, its a nice thing to do when watching a movie or something like that, or when doing nothing else, just listening to 
        music and thinking about things. Its a relaxing thing to do, but never erally did fit me very much, so I never got into a whole ton. However, 
        one of the bigger reasons I like crocheting, is that it comes in handy when you need a present for someone's birthday / christmas, but you are 
        completely broke. (:
