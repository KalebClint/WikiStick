    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Now. I havn't actaully started 3d printing, but I have wanted to for a very long time, and will soon get my very own 
        3d printer to do with what I wish. So I will start with what I plan to do, and then later update this when I actually have.

    </p>          
 

    <h3>Getting a 3d printer.</h3>
    <p>As of writing this, there is a good chance I will have my own printer by the next week. I have planned with my dad and will be working 
        on a project for him, so in return he'll get me a printer. From at least now till the next couple months, then I might start getting paid.
        We'll likely order the printer on monday, which is why I say likely the next week. As depending on what we get and where we get it from, I am 
        hoping it will arrive within the same week.
        <br>Originaly the printer I was wanting to get was the Neptune 3 pro from Elegoo. I found it to be at a decently cheap price, and had a decent amount 
        of functions and things I wanted it to do. It looked like a good printer, and although it doesn't have a huge printing size, it would still work 
        more than suitably for me.
        <br>The problem however, is that Elegoo for some reason will not ship to New Zealand at all, they have an option for australia, but none for New Zealand.
        I looked a little bit and couldn't find a single place that would get a Netpune 3 pro to us. My dad mentioned we would be able to get the Neptune 4 pro from a 
        place in new zealand, but that is a bit more expensive. So I'm not sure, if we don't do that one, my guess is we will settle on a simple ender creality. Not 
        horribly advanced or great, but again, it would get the job done. I am hoping for a neptune however, as they seem to be quite nice. Although price range from pro 3
        to creality isn't big, the Neptunes simply feel more advanced.

    <h2>Before I Have One</h2>

    <h3>What I plan to do.</h3>
    <p>3D printing for me has always seemed like such a cool thing. Getting a visual representation of something on a screen, anything really,
        and then a device literally brings it to physical life. I have several friends who have 3D printers, and have been excited at the 
        prospect of one for quite some time.
        <br>Getting a 3d printer is also especially exciting for me since I do 3d moedelling, so not only would I be able to find things to print, 
        but also create and design my owns things with a 3d Printer as well.
        <br><br>There are five key areas that I want to use a 3d printer for, and once I get one it will likely be printing 24/7 for the first month 
        at least. Before I run out of ideas, maybe even longer. 3d printing will likely consume my life for at least a short time.

         <li>Organization</li>
         <ul>
        
        <p>I have seen several things online and am excited to use it for this. Once I get a 3d printer I plan to organize several things 
            by quite a bit. 3d Printing all sorts of different types of containers to perfecctly suit sepcific needs. For example, we have 
            several rechargable batteries, both tripple and double a. Printing out a pair of containers to hold them in a neet, but also cool 
            way. One container for charged batteries, another for used batteries. 
            Right now the batteries arn't sorted and are all thrown in a small container not big enough to hold them. 
            <br>This is only one small thing however, I will likely print an assortment of containers for the desk in my room, for my desk
            in the garage (my pc and 3d printer stuff,) and maybe even elsewhere.
            <br>Another example of this organization will be for headphones. I have like two pairs of good headphones, one partially broken, one 
            where the jack is broken, and one in the garage that isn't mine. I've seen all sorts of really cool headphone holders that I can 
            use to hang the headphones, not only would it be more neat but also very cool. A couple of headphones I might hang on the walls as well.
            <br>Other ideas are for say hanging chargers / cords, holding bookmarks, special containers to hold different pens and pencils, etc.
            <br>Overall I expect that a lot in both my room and the garage will become much neater, at lest in the areas I work in. Which will again, 
            not only be neat, but pretty cool as well.
        </p>

    </ul>
        
        <li>Gifts</li>

        <ul>

        <p>Another big reason, espcailly since christmas is coming up as I write this, is gifts. I am generally broke, but overall not very good at going
            out to the store and finding a present. One that's not too expensive, but also suits the person. I enjoy getting good gifts for people, but it 
            can definately be a hassle sometimes.
            <br>Gettings a 3d printer would help quite a bit, suddenly gifts are cheeper, easier, and more customizable as well. I could even go and create 
            something myself on the computer, that would perfectly fit them. It would make giving gifts so much easier for me, while also allowing me to give 
            people frankly even cooler gifts.
        </p>

        </ul>

        <li>Fidget Toys</li>

        <ul>

        <p>I've seen so many of them, while online the amount of 3d printed fidget toys or desk stands I've seen. I want them all honestly, theres probably
            way more that I havn't even seen yet either. I am definately the kind of person that loves fidget toys, and coll desk toys would also be really 
            nice for me as well. Although this isn't really a reason I want a 3d printer, it is most definately a big bonus.

        </p>

         </ul>

        <li>Gadgets / Designing my own.</li>

        <ul>

        <p>Cool Gadgets would also be super awesome to 3D print, I've seen a few things that not only are cool, but could be pretty useful to add to 
            my stuff. I have a lot of hobbies, so there are a lot of different things I could print that would make certain things so much easier. However,
            designing my own stuff is a big reason as well. For example, I've had an idea of a pretty cool desk toy to design. I would get a few tech Peices
            that would be needed, print it out, do a bit of coding and put it together. As of right now it woudl be very difficult and annoying to create, but 
            with a 3d printer it becomes so easy.
            <br>One idea I've had is a rocking italian had, one thats balanced and you can rock it so it makes the italian motion. However, it would be cool 
            to add certain tech peices to it so whenever it detects someone saying 'Why.' It will rock itself for a few seconds. This is definately something I 
            want to try, and would be cool if I could get it done.
            <br>Things like that would be really cool, to be able to play around with creating my own gadgets, combging 3d printing with some tech and figuring out 
            what cool things I would be able to make. 
            
        </p>

        </ul>

        <li>Armour.</li>

        <ul>

        <p>Need I say more? The absolute dream for me, would be to 3d print a suit of Spartan armour, if possible, even do it for highschool graduation.
            <br>Now this is somethign I wouldn't do right away, as I'd likely wait until I have more of an income. As it would likely be very expensive. 
            A ton of filament, paint, things like the visor, primers, and all that sort of stuff. Not to mention, since I have no experience printing armor, 
            I would likely make several mistakes that would result in me needing to re-print things. Especialyl since I don't think there are many great guides 
            to printing armour online.
            <br> However, I will also wait since its better for me to have more experience 3d printing overall. But eventually, I defintely want a full spartan suit 
            of armour, preferebly Noble six's. After that however, you can bet I'll be printing a few different masks, maybe even eventually another couple full suits 
            of armour as well. Its something that I want to get heavily in when I'm older.
