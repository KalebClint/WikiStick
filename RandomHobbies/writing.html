    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>I have been a writer for a very long time, I could almost say as long as I remember. Several of my sisters are also writers,
        although no one has published anything yet. Its more of a hobby for several of us I suppose, and thats likely how it will be 
        with me as well, but I guess we'll see.
        <br>I wanted to become an author for while, recently I havn't been so sure however, thinking about leaning more into game dev, 
        maybe even cyber security as well. Two of my other hobbies that I'm pretty interested in. Writing however, would probably be the 
        longest standing hobby that I have.

    <h2>NanoWrimo</h2>
    <p>Nanowrimo, or Nationanol Novel Writing Month, is probably one of the main reasons most of my family are into writing at all. It's 
        basically a challange where every november, you have to write 50,000 words within that month. I'm actually writing this during 
        Nanowrimo. (Yes, I am adding it to my word count.) In my memory, I have never failed a NanoWrimo, having always succeeded at the goal
        I set myself.
        <br>When I was younger, I would go for smaller goals, I think a couple times I only went for about 20,000, but I did always make it. Then
        at one point I decided I wanted to do more. Insead of doing 50,000 words however, I did 60,000. The next year, I did 100,000 words in one month.
        But for somewhat reason, I didn't stop. I decided it was a little bit of a pattern. from 20, to 60, to 100. So I decided each year I would 
        add on 40,000 words. So yes, the next year I wrote 140,000 words in one month.
        <br>But I wasn't finished. I wasn't satisfied. I yearned for a challange, I yearned for more. The next year. I wrote 180,000 words.
        <br>Sike, I lied, I didn't continue the patern. I WENT FOR 200,000 WORDS.
        <br>I completed it, and it was difficult, I just about died that november. I think it may have been my limit. That was last year.
        <br>So this year, I decided why not, I would shoot for the moon. I am currently attempting to write 300,000 words in a singular month.
        That means, 10,000 words every single day. However, me being me, I didn't write for like the first two weeks. Infact it wasn't until like 
        the sixteenth that I actually really started writing.
        <br>I'm honestly not sure if I'll make it, to reach my goal, I have to write 33,000 words every day, for one week. Only then will I reach 
        300,000 words. However here I am, working on my wiki, rather than writing. Although I am including this in my word count, I ahve to be including 
        everything in my word count.
        <br>I had thought I was making a comeback, I had writing 24000 words a couple days ago, in a single day. But I only reached like 20,000 words the next 
        day. Turns out, it is unbeleivably draining. I could do it if I really needed to, but I got so tired that I had just about no motivation to continue.
        So I doubt I will reach 30,000 words. I will try, and we'll see how many I can get written. In my defence however, this has been about the busiest november 
        I have ever had, without including Nanowrimo.

    <h3>Why I like It</h3>
    <p>I love writing, but I'm pretty certain that I write very different from many people. For isntance, I have only written a few second drafts, I simply 
        cannot bring myself to continue writing the same story over and over again. This is part of the reason I'm not sure I'll ever publish a book, as I simply 
        get too excited about new ideas, I find it difficult to continue my old ones.
        <br>Often when I write, I dont plan out too much, at least not specificaly at all. When I write, its almost like reading a book for me, I'm able to come up with 
        what happens while I write it. So I'm practiaclly reading a book, while at the same time creating it. Which I think is part of the reason I really 
        like writing.
        <br><br>The main reason I love writing however, will be linked very similarly to many of my other hobbies. Its what I woudl put as the thing I enjoy the most. I love
        creating and finding stories. As a child, I literally lived inside my imagination. I would constantly be playing outside or on the trampoline, daydreaming and 'playing'
        inside my worlds. Eventually I got into reading, thanks to my family, and started with Percy Jackson. Once I got into reading, I wouldn't stop, it was something I loved and 
        did very, very often.
        <br>I suppose as a child I'd always wanted some sort of magical adventure, and the closest possible way for me to ever get that, is with stories. When I read or watch movies 
        I can almost experience the world that I'm being shown. I can see it and hear it. When I play video games, I can not only see and hear it, but choose what I do, I can succeed and 
        fail in thos great adventures. Even use magic and weapons. 
        <br>So naturally, I love creating those things as well, becouse although experiencing the worlds other people have made is great, being able to create and experience my own 
        world was something I loved more. Something that I did all the time when I was young. But thruogh books, movies, games, I can actually see and experience my world in different ways.
        This is the real reason I love writing.
